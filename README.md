# Eco Clean | Milestone Project 4

### Why I made this site

Eco Clean is an App that allows users to buy natural Eco friendly cleaning 
and self care products as an alternative to the chemical heavy versions sold in
most supermarkets and stores. 
This is my final project at the end of [Code Institute's](https://codeinstitute.net/) Full
Stack Web Developer course. This site should showcase my hard work over the last year
to include both front-end and back-end development. This site is written in
HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery, Python and Django.

### The purpose of this site

This site was created as a fully- fledged e-commerce websit , using Stripe's API
to process the payment side.

### User Stories

> As a user I would like to be able buy natural self care products online rather 
that the chemical heavy alternatives sold in most high street stores

> I need to an App where I can purchase natural cleaning products for myhousehold as 
I have a yound child with allergies 

### UX

I wanted to create a simple and intuitive web site which users can browse through
both shop and blog features with ease. I wanted to use a natural color palatte and 
the design clean and un-cluttered to allow for a positive user experience 

##Features 

This site is primarily designed as an ecommerce site but also has a blog feature 
where only registered users can add a blog post
